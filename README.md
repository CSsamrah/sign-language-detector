# sign-language-detector
<p><b>Developed a groundbreaking Sign Language Detector using Python, integrating key libraries such as Mediapipe, TensorFlow, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, and OpenCV. Implemented a holistic model for comprehensive hand and body pose recognition, bridging the communication gap between non-speakers and speakers through real-time sign language gesture detection. Leveraged TensorFlow for optimization and Scikit-learn for robust model training with a curated dataset. Used Matplotlib for visualization and OpenCV for image processing, ensuring accurate gesture recognition. Led the end-to-end development, from custom model training to real-time implementation, showcasing proficiency in machine learning, computer vision, and software development.</b></p><br><img src="C:\Users\Tesla Laptops\Pictures\Screenshots\Screenshot 2023-12-22 224012.png">
